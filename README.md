# SEQUENCES

**Unleashing the Raw Chaos of Computational Order!**

---

**WARNING:** This project is not for the faint of heart, the easily offended, or those afraid of witnessing pure algorithmic madness. Enter the realm of **Sequences**, a terrifyingly intricate labyrinth of code, logic, and raw computational power. If you dare.

## WHAT IS SEQUENCES?

`Sequences` is an unapologetic ode to the beauty and brutality of algorithms. It brings together dynamic data structures, hashing, error handling, and mind-bending complexity to deliver an experience that will either sharpen your programming skills or shatter your fragile sense of control.

### Core Features:
- **Dynamic Vectors**: Insert, remove, and manipulate sequences with reckless abandon.
- **HashMap Wizardry**: Experience key-value storage so robust it laughs in the face of collision chaos.
- **Menu of Doom**: A text-based UI that dares you to make a choice—just don't get it wrong.
- **Error Hellscape**: A comprehensive yet unsettlingly judgmental error reporting system.

---

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

- **C Compiler**: GCC recommended (clang optional if you're a daredevil).
- **Memory**: Enough RAM to simulate a small server farm.
- **Patience**: Infinite. This isn't for the casual coder.

## QUICK START

1. Clone this beast of a repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kingofjazzpiano/sequences.git
   cd sequences
   ```
2. Compile it if you dare:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. Launch the inferno:
   ```bash
   ./sequences
   ```

## HOW IT WORKS

Brace yourself for some technical carnage:

- **Vectors**: Expand and shrink like an algorithmic accordion. Overflow? More like *overkill*.  
- **HashMaps**: Backed by Knuth's multiplicative method—because when it comes to hashing, we go nuclear.  
- **Error Handling**: The error codes will haunt your dreams. Miss a pointer? Nullify your hopes.

## MENUS: A ROGUE'S GUIDE

The UI doesn't hold your hand; it slaps you in the face.

- **Initialize New Sequence**: Start fresh—if you can.  
- **Choose Sequence**: Switch to another sequence. No regrets allowed.  
- **Insert Term**: Add a number where it doesn't belong.  
- **Remove Term**: Pray you don't pick the wrong index.  
- **Extract Unique Terms**: Because redundancy is for cowards.  
- **Exit**: If you have the guts to leave.

## CODE STRUCTURE

- **`vector.c`** and **`vector.h`**: The lifeblood of dynamic data.  
- **`hash_map.c`** and **`hash_map.h`**: Collisions? Handled.  
- **`error.c`** and **`error.h`**: Errors are inevitable, but at least you'll know why you're doomed.  
- **`ui.c`**: The sadistic mastermind behind the user interface.
